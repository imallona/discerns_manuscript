# Novel exon analysis pipeline

This repository contains the scripts and code used in the DISCERNS paper. It is based on a snakemake pipeline that includes all code to simulate an RNA-seq dataset and to generate GTF files with reduced annotation. Besides, the workflow compares STAR and hisat2 using the simulated data. It also predicts novel exons with DISCERNS and StringTie and generates Precision-Recall curves.
